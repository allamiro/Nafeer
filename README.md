# The Nafeer Open Source Project

The Nafeer Open Source Project is an initiative led by a volunteer team of young individuals, dedicated to providing assistance to families impacted by severe rainfall and flash floods in different regions of Khartoum State.

This open-source project is designed for a global audience, particularly for volunteer groups seeking an open-source solution to address similar crisis situations.

The software will be developed using CodeIgniter version 3.x.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, you're warmly welcomed to get in touch with me at `tsuliman@linuxvaults.com`, or alternatively, clone the project via Git - you're probably familiar with the process.

## The application comprises the following key components:

1. **Web Front End**: This interface will include menus, a slideshow, and a link to report incidents.

2. **Authentication System**: This will cater to System Users and System Admin Users. System Users will be segregated into four permission groups, two of which will be defined based on their respective assignments/sections:
   - Users
   - Team Leads
   - Directors
   - Admins

3. **Designs and Wireframes**: 

   **Frontpage**: This webpage will feature a slideshow in the center and links to various other pages such as:
      - Login/Signin Page: Allows registered volunteers, users, team leads, and admins to login and execute their roles as per their permissions. A 'Forgot Password' option will be available for resetting passwords.
      - Users can only modify their personal details. Team leads can form groups and add users to them. Directors can alter sections, while admins have the power to manage the entire system, including the creation of user accounts.

4. **Signin Front UI page**

5. **Incident Reporting System**: 

   - Reporting Page
   - Reporting Management Page
